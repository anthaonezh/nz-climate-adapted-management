## Outline

### 1.0 Project Scoping & Species Selection
- Defining management objectives under climate change
- Prioritizing invasive species based on climate vulnerability and impact
- Engaging stakeholders and rights holders (including iwi/hapū)

### 2.0 Climate Impact Analysis
- Identifying relevant climate drivers (temperature, precipitation, extreme events)
- Projecting future climate scenarios for the management region
- Assessing direct and indirect impacts on invasive species biology and distribution

### 3.0 Adaptation of Control Methods
- Reviewing existing control methods and their climate sensitivity
- Developing climate‑resilient or adaptive control strategies
- Integrating novel technologies and approaches (e.g., biocontrol, genetic tools)

### 4.0 Monitoring & Evaluation
- Designing monitoring programs that detect climate‑driven changes
- Setting adaptive management triggers and decision points
- Evaluating effectiveness and updating plans iteratively

### 5.0 Cultural & Community Considerations
