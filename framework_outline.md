# Climate-Adapted Invasive Species Management Framework
## Outline

### 1.0 Project Scoping & Species Selection
- Defining management objectives under climate change
- Prioritizing invasive species based on climate vulnerability and impact
- Engaging stakeholders and rights holders (including iwi/hapū)

### 2.0 Climate Impact Analysis
- Identifying relevant climate drivers (temperature, precipitation, extreme events)
- Projecting future climate scenarios for the management region
- Assessing direct and indirect impacts on invasive species biology and distribution
- **2.1 Case Studies**
  - *Case Study 1: Argentine ant (Linepithema humile)* – Warmer temperatures and reduced frost frequency are allowing this invasive ant to expand its range southward in New Zealand, threatening native invertebrates and disrupting ecosystems. (Source: [TODO: add citation])
  - *Case Study 2: Wilding conifers (Pinus contorta and others)* – Increased drought stress in some regions may reduce seedling survival, but warmer winters could enhance seed production and spread into alpine areas. (Source: [TODO: add citation])
  - *Case Study 3: Ship rat (Rattus rattus)* – More frequent extreme rainfall events may affect breeding cycles and food availability, while milder winters could increase overwinter survival and population growth. (Source: [TODO: add citation])

### 3.0 Adaptation of Control Methods
- Reviewing existing control methods and their climate sensitivity
- Developing climate‑resilient or adaptive control strategies
- Integrating novel technologies and approaches (e.g., biocontrol, genetic tools)

### 4.0 Monitoring & Evaluation
- Designing monitoring programs that detect climate‑driven changes
- Setting adaptive management triggers and decision points
- Evaluating effectiveness and updating plans iteratively

### 5.0 Cultural & Community Considerations
- Incorporating Mātauranga Māori (Māori knowledge) and kaitiakitanga
- Addressing social and economic implications of management shifts
- Fostering community engagement and participatory decision‑making
