# Climate-Adapted Invasive Species Management Framework for Aotearoa New Zealand

## Purpose
This project develops a decision-support framework for integrating climate change considerations into invasive species management in Aotearoa New Zealand. The framework aims to help conservation managers adapt their strategies to shifting climate conditions, ensuring long-term effectiveness and resilience of native ecosystems.

## Background
Current invasive species management plans often rely on historical climate patterns. With climate change causing temperature shifts, altered rainfall, and increased extreme weather events, these plans may become ineffective or even harmful. This collaborative framework provides a structured approach to incorporate climate projections, species distribution modeling, and adaptive management principles.
